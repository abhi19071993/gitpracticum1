# Recommender systems based on Amazon review data using Machine learning 

Problem statement:
---
  The problem our model works on is that when an internet user wants to use an e-commerce platform like amazon to buy a product, the one thing they trust are the reviews. So, our model tries to get data related to products and their ratings/reviews and work on it. We use sentiment analysis on the reviews and create a sentiment summary for a list of keywords.Our model at the end suggests the desired products to users based on their individual interests and overall ratings of the products.
